For the rest of you, you probably already have some concept of what &ldquo;search&rdquo; means. That said, I was struggling to put that concept into words, so this will have to do:</p><p><img src=google.png alt="&ldquo;what is search in internet terms&rdquo;"></p><p>This was the first definition I found (paraphrased):</p><blockquote><p>Search refers to the process of using a search engine to find information, web pages, or data on the internet.</p></blockquote><p>That sounds nice, but we can do a little bit of algebra to simplify it</p><ul><li>data is just information</li><li>web pages mostly just contain information</li><li>it&rsquo;s not specific to search engines anymore</li></ul><p>So we&rsquo;re left with:</p><blockquote><p>Search is the process of finding information.</p></blockquote><p>But is this really accurate? If the goal was just to find any information, then I would say LLMs are equally useful to search engines; they both provide lots of information quickly when given a query. So, let&rsquo;s make our definition slightly more specific:</p><blockquote><p>Search is the process of finding <em>good</em> information.</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-makes-information-good>What makes information good?</h2><p>The answer to this question will vary from case to case, but <em>typically</em> I find that information is good when it is <strong>factual</strong>. Subjective information has its uses, too, but I would estimate at least 80% of my searches are to find facts.</p><p>Particularly as a programmer, I&rsquo;m often trying to find information about how to make the computer do a thing, or why the computer has done a thing, and these tend to be the objective type of information.</p><p>On the off chance I <em>do</em> want to search for subjective information, LLMs are probably the wrong place to look; they don&rsquo;t think, so they can&rsquo;t form opinions, so you probably don&rsquo;t want to replace that aspect of search with an LLM anyways. I hope.</p><p>With that out of the way, let&rsquo;s focus on the process of finding facts.</p><p>The process of using an LLM vs. a search engine is very similar:</p><ol><li>You input your query</li><li>You read some statements on the screen</li><li>You decide whether those statements are true or false</li></ol><p>If the process is the same, what makes LLMs so much worse for finding facts?</p><h2 id=llms-remove-metadata>LLMs remove metadata</h2><p>The problem with using LLMs for search is that you are presented with a statement, and you have to decide, right then and there: <em>&ldquo;chat, is this true?&rdquo;</em></p><p>With a search engine, you actually have lots of additional metadata that you can factor into this decision:</p><ul><li>how reputable is this website?</li><li>does the author of the statement seem confident?</li><li>is the information old, and possibly out of date?</li><li>has the information been disputed?</li><li>does another search result corroborate this statement?</li></ul><p>Depending on the website, you may even have additional pieces of information:</p><ul><li>did a lot of people &lsquo;upvote&rsquo; this statement?</li><li>are there replies calling this statement incorrect?</li><li>does the author of the statement have a really dumb avatar?</li></ul><p>All of this valuable information is stripped away and obfuscated by LLMs, leaving you with no option but to trust that the machine, which is incapable of thought, knows best.</p><h2 id=separating-fact-from-fiction>Separating fact from fiction</h2><p>Even with search engines, this part is hard. The goal of finding facts on the internet is a challenging and noble pursuit. However, I believe it&rsquo;s a skill that can be practiced and trained.</p><p>With LLMs, there&rsquo;s nothing to improve upon. Sure, you could try appending &ldquo;no lies&rdquo; and &ldquo;engage maximum truth mode&rdquo; to the end of your prompt, but it leaves you in the same situation regardless.</p><p>For now, I&rsquo;m going to stick to search engines, and I think you should too.</p></div></main></div></body></html>
